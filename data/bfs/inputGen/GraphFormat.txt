A directed graph is represented as adjacent lists
* each node is randomly connected to another node
* each edge has a weight associated. 

File format to store a graph, two two lists
* list of nodes: with node id 0 to m-1
  
* list of edges: with edge id 0 to n-1
  each node's edges are stored together to ensure data locality using BFS traversal

  
line 1: 100  // number of nodes
line 2: 0 7  // node id 0: start edge id is 0, with total 7 edges
line 3: 7 3  // node id 1: start edge id 7, total 3 edges
..
line x: 567 5 // node id x-1: start edge id 567, total 5 edges
             // space
line y:   24   // source node's id is 24, we calculate distance from node 24 to all others
..
         572   // total number of edges
	 0 8   // edge id 0: destination node id is 0, with weight 8
	 0 8    // edge id 1: destination node id is 0, weight 8
	 20 10  // edge id 2: destination node id is 20, weight 10
...
         73 5   // edge id 570, destination node id 73, weight 5
